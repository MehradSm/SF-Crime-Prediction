## San Francisco Crime Prediction
In this project we want to predict crime categories in San Francisco based on the dataset provided on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime). This dataset includes incidents over 12 years from 1/1/2003 to 5/13/2015, and derived from SF Police Department Crime Incident Reporting system. Here, we used Linear Regression and Logistic Regression to analyze the data in MATLAB. 


### Data
The original deta is available on Kaggle [San Francisco Crime Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime). Here, we provide the pre-processed data
in a MATLAB file SFcrime.mat 

### Code 
Our Codes are available on SFcrimeAnalysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file in which all visualization and data analysis are described.
